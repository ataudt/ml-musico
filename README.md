# ML-Musico

This art project develops a Machine counterpart for a musical live performance with a jazz trio.
It is able to recognize emotions from the audience, and gives instructions to the performers in order to achieve a predefined dramaturgy.

## Face recognition from the audience

Face recognition is based on this project https://github.com/petercunha/Emotion.git and uses a WebCam Feed with OpenCV and Deep Learning.
